Hello world!

 - Designed around the idea of subjective truth.
 - Random conversation tree builder.
 - Binary decision trees for classifying statements.
 - Sentiment classification.
 - Statement or question?
 - Love or hate?
 - Good or evil?
 - Or both or neither?
 - Overlapping concepts: Love and good. Evil and hate.
 - Dialectic.
 - How do you know love and good are overlapping concepts?
 - A positive tag is the opposite of a purely logical negation tag: "Said by Oscar Wilde." or "Not said by Oscar Wilde."
 - When does statistics of popular opinion win over authority? Similarity of opinions.
 - Example question: Which is better, C or C++?
 - Assocation game.
 - How does information flow to screen by decisions made?
  - Similarity to other users. Decisions in the past.
  - Decisions today.
  - Categorical or aspect oriented channels.
- Should links be allowed or just quick link to google text snippet? I guess they can be allowed at own risk.
- Some kind of multi-faceted textual classification or moderation scheme.
- Garbage in, garbage out.
- Timeline.
- Investment portfolio gaining value by predicting news sentiments.
- Evolve engine step by step.
- Association graph: Starting point: Welcome. Mind map. For each user?
- How to decide which binary feature vector to ask user to classify current statement?
- Don't want too much garbage in the system. It's a moderation and combination system.
- Novel ideas should be structured by primitive forms, not in complex sentence form.
- Novel ideas requiring elaborate and complex explanation must be presented elsewhere and linked to.
- Therefore the limitation imposed is that for a sentence to be well-formed it must have at least one Google hit? Or maybe a soft limit.
